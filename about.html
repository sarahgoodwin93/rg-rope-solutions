                        I am an IRATA Level 3 supervisor and Stage 3 Rigger with a wide variety of experience in the oil and gas, both onshore and offshore, 
                        industrial and geotechnical sectors nationally and internationally. I am a highly motivated and skilled worker with a passion for rope access.

                    <p class="page-description">
                        I have been involved in large scale projects onshore and offshore including flare tip removals, box flare renovations, LOLER inspections, 
                        crane boom inspections, milos hex projects, TAR shutdowns, decommissioning projects and various rigging scopes. Along with this I have had 
                        the opportunity to supervise squads on a daily basis of various trades who require rope access to carry out their work.
